I have always wanted to do a series of children's books about adventures in other places/ecosystems to teach them about intersections between science and culture. And so, I am going to use this opportunity to do just that. I already have the story, though I'll edit the writing to be more appropriate and exciting for an elementary-middle school-aged group.
