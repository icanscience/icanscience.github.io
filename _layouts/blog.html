	<p>I Can Science: Puerto Rico</p>
	
	</header>
	
	

	<p>

Being a scientist is the best career I can imagine. But becoming a scientist took a lot of hard work and your path may not be a straight line. Mine definitely wasn't. I Can Science is a show that takes you into the world as some of the coolest scientists ever. You'll hear how they got started and see the incredible things they get to do. Let's face it, we can science and you can science too. <br>

This digital series pilot centers on five resilient scientists who are revitalizing Puerto Rico with the innovative research, engaging instruction, and community outreach they are doing on the island. Through their inspiring stories, I Can Science shows that becoming a successful scientist is possible, even for those who follow non-linear career paths, come from marginalized communities, or work in places where the obstacles are especially daunting. It also emphasizes the fact that, while scientists may at first seem intimidating, they are often among the most fun and friendly people youâ€™ll ever meet.
