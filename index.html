	   <p> <b>Wild Hope Adventures</b>  uses culturally relevant adventure storytelling to help reignite the passion, pride, and “Wild Hope” that many Puerto Ricans have for their island. With digital videos and books, we are increasing 1) student interest in and knowledge of Puerto Rican wildlife and habitats, 2) their ability to cope positively with natural disasters by becoming agents of change, 3) awareness of those helping to restore ecosystems post Hurricane Maria, 4) positive attitudes towards science and scientists, and 5) interest in pursuing science careers in general, especially by seeing culturally-matched science role models.

<b><a href="http://icanscience.org/episode/">I Can Science Puerto Rico</a></b> is a visually stunning and uplifting 5-part educational adventure video series to highlight the resilience of female Puerto Rican scientists studying neuroscience, data science, biology, engineering, and marine science in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

  <br>

After the hurricane, Puerto Ricans were without cell phone reception and electricity. The island they loved was badly destroyed, everywhere you looked, neighbors were working together to rebuild. In the treasured El Yunque forest, the hurricane opened up the canopy and new growth in response to the light.

Dr. Lilliam Casilla searches for new antibiotics to treat bacterial infections that are becoming impossible to treat. New antibiotics could save millions of lives. Dr. Casilla is making microbiology a more welcoming place for women and minorities in science because right now we need all hands on deck (or in Petri dishes) to ensure a healthier tomorrow.

A radio telescope at Arecibo Observatory in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, was made famous by the movie Contact in 1997. It is still one of largest and most important telescopes today, but it was damaged in the hurricane. Karina Tañon-De Jesús and a team of undergraduate researcher at University of Puerto Rico Mayagüe build drones that fly over the telescope and detect damages in the aluminium panels.

You define yourself. You decide what you have the aptitude for or the desire to achieve. Go for it. You decide if it's for you or not, but you can't let others tell you what to do. People told Dr. Patti Ordóñez is solving complex problems design thinking and data. Dr Chelsea Harms-Tuohy started her own business leading field courses in Puerto Rico. By combining environmental DNA testing with high-throughput data analysis, we can detect the presence or absence of species to identify the most and least resilient to natural disasters. We hope there won’t be another destructive hurricane, but science can help us plan for the future.
