This blog is inspired by this document: [Software Carpentry: lessons learned [version 2; referees: 3 approved]](https://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v2)

I'm I am to think about the lessons leaned, 
I first first think about what happened.
So, here's my first past at recalling the detailes.  

## 2015
In January 2015, Titus Brown, Tracy Teal, Greg Wilson, 
and a dozen others orchestrated  
the first of many Carpentry Instructor Training events 
at the University California, of Davis. 
I had met Drs Brown and Teal previously.
We crossed paths with Dr Teal and Brown
on many occasions at Michigan State via the 
BEACON Center for Evolution in Action
and the Marine Biological Laboratory summer courses. 
Today, 3 years and 4 months later,
I'm still talking and working with the three of them 
regularly. Based on the nature of the small network
this story of lessons learned will likely have a North America / genomics
the biased view of the world.

Later that year, I taught 2 Software Carpentry workshops with at least 6 instructors 
from Texas and Arizona to teach Shell, Git, R, and Python.

Later Dr Wilson recruited me into the mentoring group 
During that time, it was great to be actively teaching and 
actively talking to other instructors in regular discussions
and blogging about the experience.

## 2016
In 2016 the steering committee was in full swing and had a lot on their plates.
The steering committee attempted to make sense of community growth
New pathways to involvement were set up. 
Community hubs developed with increased in-person instructor training. 

# 2017
I also beefed up on some technical skills
Dr Teal invited me to a Moore Foundation Data-Driven Discovery symposium
and as a Jupiter Notebook for reproducibility hackathon.
Later Erin Becker and Francois Michonneau lured me into
Lesson Maintenance and Maintainer On-boarding.
This is when I added python, make, and git into my bag of tools.

and to a PLOS Comp Biology 10 simple rules paper.
here I learned that collaborative writing is fun but that it comes with unique challenges. 
we wrote this paper without ever meeting in person. 
I edited one of the drawings in an airport in Buenos Aires.
We used GitHub for version control and tracking changes. 
Technically, the paper submission was challenging.

## 2016 - 18 
Dr Wilson plants seeds about workshops in Mexico.
Later Dr Teal invited me 
to Puerto Rico for Instructor training.
And I went to OpenCon which opened the door 
for lessons development in Argentina
which led to the door for Spanish workshops in California
