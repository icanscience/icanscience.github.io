excerpt: "I knew really early on that this is what I wanted to do. I think it really depends on what you value in your life. It was a hard decision to start a career and a job knowing that it would never really bring me back to home."

My name is Dr Chelsea Harms-Tuohy, and I am a fish biologist in Puerto Rico. 

I was in middle school. I had an opportunity to go to a summer camp down at Texas A&M in Galveston and that's really what opened the doors to this field of marine biology and marine science. I got to dissect a shark and sit in on a dolphin autopsy, which is not something I think most people would appreciate, and it was there that I decided, you know, this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I want to be studying fish.

_Being a scientist is the best career I can imagine, but becoming a scientist took a lot of hard work, and your path may not be a straight line. Mine definitely wasn't. I Can Science is a show that takes you into the world of some of the coolest scientists ever. You'll hear how they got started and see the incredible things they get to do. Let's face it, we can science and you can science too._

You're not originally from here. Where are you from? I'm from Texas. From landlocked. Tyler, Texas. You're from Texas. I'm from Texas. What is your favorite Texas saying? Oh Gosh. Fixing to. We're fixing to do something right now. I love spending time with scientists, working in fields, so different from mine. While, my work involves collecting samples from our feathered friends on land. Chelsea collects hers from the Ocean. Specifically, she's working to develop a new technique for gathering information about what types of fish are close by detecting traces of their own DNA they behind while swimming through the water. Here she is teaching me how to collect water samples from the ocean floor using a technique I like to call the loop swish and 'tada. Now we're going to bring those samples back to her lab and learn what the heck she does with them. Not only does Chelsea live on the stunning island of Puerto Rico, she gets to take a boat to her lab on one of the islands islands. Isla Mar is Chelsea's home base for conducting research and teaching future scientists about marine biology.

This is the lab of Dr Nick Schizas. It's the marine genomics biodiversity lab. First Stop the filtering station. Here's where her team filters out that fishy DNA from the water samples we just collected. There, we bumped into one of Chelsea student's, Giovanna, who was a student at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez. Giovanna pours the ocean water we just collected over a filter that traps the DNA for later identification. Perhaps they'll discover a school of grouper or snapper that has recently been in the area. Maybe the lochness monster is distant Puerto Rican cousin. Whatever they find, one of the other beauties of this approach is that it is noninvasive. There's no need to collect or disturb any fish to obtain their data, and it will give us a better idea of how endangered populations are doing too.


When you study science, sometimes students think you have to stay in academia, become a professor. But there's so many other things you can do that still involved research and education. Yes. And you're doing that. Tell me how that, how that feels. You know, I sat down, I believe it was at my defense, just sitting with my committee and they were like, well, what's your, your dream job? And I said, I'd like to start my own business leading field courses here in Puerto Rico. You know, teaching undergraduates, you know, new young scientists how to do what I do. They looked at me and they're like, well, why wait? It's what I really want to do. So why wait until I'm further into my career. Like starting your own business comes with the trials and the hardships and the challenges. I'm so thankful for where I'm at now and just, you know, being open to accepting those challenges. I'm not looking back.


Research is... it looks glamorous sometimes when we see it in the movies, but it's early mornings and long days, as Giovanna knows. She was filtering our samples until 2:00 AM the other day. Yeah, that's the unglamorous side. But you know, we'll pretend this is what it is, a few discoveries and a beautiful sunset. Can you tell me what is it that you love the most about Puerto Rico? The people you know, coming from Texas where you're used to, everybody being so friendly and just so trusting and honest and coming down here and that's exactly its like. What do you love most about Puerto Rico? The food.

Speaking of, if it's getting close to dinner time, but for now, I couldn't think of anything else I'd rather be doing than talking science with these gals as we watch the sunset and endless ocean of possibilities before us. Just remember to mind the Iguanas.
