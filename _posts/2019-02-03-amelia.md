My mom is one of the most inspirational people in my life, really, because even with my sister and I, she was able to study and get a doctorate, get a PhD in botany and that's something amazing to me.

My name is Emilia Merced. I am a biologist. I study plants, but recently I've been working in neuroscience looking at fruit flies.

Amelia works at the prestigious institute of Neurobiology located in old San Juan. Like so many of us, Amelia's path to becoming a scientist was not a straight line. Although she began her career as a botanist, her exceptional microscopy skills earned her a postdoc position, here, studying the connections between brains and motor functions in fruit flies. Every day she commutes to one of Puerto Rico's most beautiful oceanfront spot. Just steps from el Morro road, the fortress built in the 16th century to protect the island from enemy attacks.

I grew up here in Puerto Rico. When I was growing up, I never met a scientist. Through my teachers, I learned that there is a path if you want to do science, you have to learn in science. You need to learn to adapt and you need to learn to be comfortable with the things you don't know. I remember all my childhood who have been playing outside and through that playing was where I discovered that I wanted to ask questions and do an investigation. So for me, it was that idea of discovery and exploration. What really drives me.

So when the hurricane Maria came, this is my house, this is where we were. So the door we had it closed and it was just shaking, shaking, shaking like, do you know the whole horror movies when you say like that? So I took my kids and then we move to my room here to the back. Yeah. So here, this is where, where we spent most of the hurricane. How long, how long were you in here for? A lot of hours. Like the three of you. We were like so tired. I don't know if it was the pressure or what happened toour body though we were just sleeping. We you all huddled together. Ah, they are teenagers.


So, after the hurricane, we didn't have any cell phone reception. We had no electricity. And, we can not sit down and wait. Nobody came to help. I was just on us helping each other. I cried every day I come to work, like for over a week. Every week morning I got in my car and you know you're driving and you see the destruction that is around all the people that lost their houses, people that lost their families, people with medical conditions couldn't go to a hospital or couldn't get help. That was like every day I was like, I can not believe this is happening. You know the island that I love so much that is this badly destroyed. It was like a nuclear bomb exploded and there was nothing, but then you look the people and they were working and they were doing things and they were like not giving up and you're like, I'm not giving up either. 


So this is the only trail right now open to the public. Why is that? Well, because after the year again, there was so much devastation and the canopy opened. Many trees fell, the trees not the branches and the leaves. That's why you could only see the trunks. They had a big impact on the entire forest because first of all the shape was gone, so that allowed a lot of other plants to come up the forest. Now we see it again; it's green.

If you could have a superpower, what would it be? Time. Manipulate time. I'm like, I'm like the little bunny that is always like, _"I don't have enough time! I know have enough time!"_ That's me. This is the thing that I love the most. So for anybody that wants to take this path, they have to learn to be brave and not be afraid of the unknown.

Emilia may not have the superpower to control time, such gifts or the stuff of myth after all, but if you ask me, I think she has a trait that's a million times more valuable bravery.
