## Why?

On September 20, 2017, [Hurricane Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Maria) devastated the island of Puerto Rico. Ecosystems were severely damaged, and Puerto Ricans continue to suffer from lack of sufficient resources and assistance. [Dr Rebecca Calisi](http://rebeccacalisi.weebly.com/about.html) wanted to created a digital video to shift what has been a depressing environmental narrative to a positive one of action, resilience, and conservation success. 

## Who?

Dr Rebecca Calisi's team included [Dr Feliú-Mójer](https://www.monicafeliu.me/) (award-winning science communicator award-winning filmmaker), [John Mounier](https://strategiccommunications.ucdavis.edu/about/visual/mounier.html) (UC Davis Head of Visual Communications), and [CienciaPR](https://www.cienciapr.org/) (a global community dedicated to supporting Puerto Rican scientists and culturally relevant science education). Together, they have create a visually stunning and uplifting 5-part educational adventure video series to highlight the resilience of female Puerto Rican scientists studying neuroscience, data science, biology, engineering, and marine science in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

## Target Audience

The target age group is middle school, a critical educational stage at which students' interest in wildlife biology and conservation is greatly influenced. The goals of this project are to 1) increase interest
in and knowledge of Puerto Rican wildlife and habitats, 2) heighten awareness of the effects of a natural disaster through a positive lens, 3) create/enhance positive attitudes towards biologists and their efforts, and 4) see adversity as a challenge to create change. Further, by using age-
appropriate and culturally relevant environmental learning constructs, Calisi hopes to promote pride and self-confidence in Puerto Rican students to be agents of change, reigniting passion, pride, and "Wild Hope" there and beyond.
