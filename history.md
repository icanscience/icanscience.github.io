On September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Puerto
Rico. Ecosystems were severely damaged, and Puerto Ricans continue to suffer from lack of sufficient resources and assistance. 

In 2018 and 2019, Rebecca Calisi and a team from the University of California Davis created a digital video to shift what has been a depressing
environmental narrative to a positive one of action, resilience, and conservation success. The team included award-winning science communicator Dr. Feliú-Mójer, award-winning filmmaker and UC Davis Head of Visual Communications John Mounier, and CienciaPR, a global community dedicated to supporting Puerto Rican scientists and culturally relevant science education. Calisi has create a visually stunning and uplifting 5-part educational adventure video
series to highlight the resilience of female Puerto Rican scientists studying neuroscience, data science, biology, engineering, and marine science in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

The target age group is middle school, a critical educational stage at which students' interest in wildlife biology and conservation is greatly influenced. The goals of this project are to 1) increase interest
in and knowledge of Puerto Rican wildlife and habitats, 2) heighten awareness of the effects of a natural disaster through a positive lens, 3) create/enhance positive attitudes towards biologists and their efforts, and 4) see adversity as a challenge to create change. Further, by using age-
appropriate and culturally relevant environmental learning constructs, Calisi hopes to promote pride and self-confidence in Puerto Rican students to be agents of change, reigniting passion, pride, and "Wild Hope" there and beyond.
